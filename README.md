# Customer-Segmentation-using-Machine-Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation for international customers based on their purchase behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## Dataset

- **Number of Observations**: 35,116
- **Number of Countries**: 37
- **Features**:
  - `InvoiceNo`: Unique ID for invoice
  - `InvoiceDate`: Date of invoice
  - `StockCode`: Unique ID for item
  - `Description`: Text description for item
  - `Quantity`: Units per pack
  - `UnitPrice`: Price per unit (GBP)
  - `CustomerID`: Unique ID for customer
  - `Country`: Country of customer

## Machine Learning Approach

- **Type of Problem**: Unsupervised learning
- **Objective**: Segment customers based on transaction data to identify meaningful clusters.
- **Clustering Method**: K-Means
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and feature selection techniques

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure quality and consistency.
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - **Thresholding**: Focus on popular items to reduce dimensionality.
   - **PCA**: Apply PCA to generate uncorrelated features that capture the most variance.
3. **Clustering**:
   - **Base DF**: Use purchase patterns to form clusters.
   - **Threshold DF**: Include important item features in clustering.
   - **PCA DF**: Combine purchase patterns with PCA-reduced features.

## Constraints

- **Scalability**: The solution must efficiently handle large volumes of transaction data.
- **Interpretability**: The clustering model should provide clear insights for marketing strategies.
- **Timeline**: Adhere to a tight project timeline with efficient and effective methods.

# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation for international customers based on their purchase behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## Dataset

- **Number of Observations**: 35,116
- **Number of Countries**: 37
- **Features**:
  - `InvoiceNo`: Unique ID for invoice
  - `InvoiceDate`: Date of invoice
  - `StockCode`: Unique ID for item
  - `Description`: Text description for item
  - `Quantity`: Units per pack
  - `UnitPrice`: Price per unit (GBP)
  - `CustomerID`: Unique ID for customer
  - `Country`: Country of customer

## Machine Learning Approach

- **Type of Problem**: Unsupervised learning
- **Objective**: Segment customers based on transaction data to identify meaningful clusters.
- **Clustering Method**: K-Means
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and feature selection techniques

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure quality and consistency.
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - **Thresholding**: Focus on popular items to reduce dimensionality.
   - **PCA**: Apply PCA to generate uncorrelated features that capture the most variance.
3. **Clustering**:
   - **Base DF**: Use purchase patterns to form clusters.
   - **Threshold DF**: Include important item features in clustering.
   - **PCA DF**: Combine purchase patterns with PCA-reduced features.

## Constraints

- **Scalability**: The solution must efficiently handle large volumes of transaction data.
- **Interpretability**: The clustering model should provide clear insights for marketing strategies.
- **Timeline**: Adhere to a tight project timeline with efficient and effective methods.
